As the title gracefully suggests, I just made my first ever logo. Looks pretty cool right? If you don't get what it's supposed to mean, (I don't blame you), within the cube exists the abbreviation of my full name.

Looks seemingly perfect, right? (in terms of symmetry I mean). Wrong. I was too excited that I literally just watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Rfu5OJ--M) 2 minute video and jumped right into it. The symmetry is way off, but to the common eye it looks good enough. So I stopped here. As for the color scheme, I picked them up randomly from the colour palette, and they looked good enough so I let them be. There's also some minor protrusions at three corners, but...

I've wanted to try logo design for a long time, and I finally picked up the tiny scraps of motivation from the ground lost eons ago, and managed to conjure up this magnificent, ethereal, abstract and an absolute beast of a logo that even Bob Ross would be proud of. (Okay I'll stop). There is so much I can improve upon this logo, but for now this will do. 

I still don't know if I might try logo design again. Sure, it was kinda frustrating, but maybe it was because I didn't know my way around the different tools which led me to randomly click each tool until I went "Aha! That's the one!". On the other hand, I loved the creativity aspect of it: making up designs in my head and having them come to life. Maybe I should try again, but this time, I actually know how to use Illustrator by watching a tutorial or something.

If you want me to design a logo, hit me up. I'll do it for free. (just the first one tho) (and i'm a lazy guy, don't expect a fixed deadline or some shit lol)

See ya later,

FR.
