Sup. My name is Faaez. I'm a CS student trying to find my way in life. I thought it'd be a good idea to document my programming journey, so here I am. Here's a cool image, to mark the dawn of my new journey.

### What I will blog about


I got a lot in my mind right now. I'll probably try to reign everything in to the programming domain, but who knows? I will probably blog about:

* how epic programming is
* how frustrating programming is
* why my college sucks
* why doesn't that darn feral cat appreciate me (i feed it every day)

Stay tuned.
